# Java-Jakarta-Servlets-Store-Practice-
Some words are in Serbian so sorry if not everyone can understand.
This small project is a store where you can add products(which have ID's(AI), names, <b>categories</b> and prices) and categories (ID(AI), name).
You must add the jakarta 2.0 API jar files in order to make it work.
This project is done using TomcatEE with jakarta API on NetBeans.
